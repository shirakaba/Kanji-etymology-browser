                          <img class="massiveimg" alt="drawnKanji" src="static/svg/drawnKanjiOptimised.svg" />
                          <p>'Kanji' are Chinese characters adopted into Japanese. The Japan's Ministry of Education deems a knowledge of 2,136 characters to be necessary for general use (ie. reading a newspaper), although university students may be expected to come to know as many as 3,000. Their mastery is non-trivial even to the Japanese native, due to their myriad readings (the very common entry 'ç”Ÿ' lists as many as 20 different possible pronunciations), order by which one must draw each stroke, and great subtlety in meaning. Through this website, one can explore much information pertinent to their study, as detailed below.</p>
